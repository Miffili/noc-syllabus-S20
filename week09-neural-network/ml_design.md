# Neural Network / ML Design Exercise

## Scenario

Describe the scenario, what "job" will the neural network do in the context of a software application?

## Problem type

1. Is this a "classification" problem? What are the labels?
2. Is this a "regression" problem?

## Learning

What approach will be used to train the model? 

1. Assuming supervised learning, what is the training dataset and how is it labeled? 
2. If this is a "reinforcement learning"-style problem, how will you "reward" the network. Examples might be a player's score for a game or how long an agent survives in an environment.

## Architecture

Describe, in informal terms, the architecture of the model. What are the inputs and what are the outputs?
